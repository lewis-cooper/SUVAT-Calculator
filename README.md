## General info
* A python based calculator to calculate the kinematic equations of motion (commonly known as the SUVAT equations)

* Built as a starter project as I teach myself python programming

## Objectives
* Intuitive calculator that's easy to use
* Quick calculations so that maths and physics students can check their workings

## To-Do
* Simplify calculator segment to determine the variables to calculate based off the blank variables rather than the filled ones:

e.g.: `if u == None and v == None:` rather than `if type(u)==float and type(v)==float and type(t)==float:`
* Perform full testing on every possibility of SUVAT combinations
* Develop a GUI version of the calculator

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.8
