## General info
* A python based calculator to calculate the kinematic equations of motion (commonly known as the SUVAT equations)

* Built as a starter project as I teach myself python programming

## Objectives
* Intuitive calculator that's easy to use
* Quick calculations so that maths and physics students can check their workings

## To-Do
* ~~Perform full testing on every possibility of SUVAT combinations~~
* ~~Develop a GUI version of the calculator~~
* Shorten/ improve efficiency of the code
* ~~Fix how error messages are displayed and removed from GUI version when user inputs are invalid~~

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.8

Modules Used:
* Math
* Tkinter (GUI version)
